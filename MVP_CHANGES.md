# MVP Changes Documentation

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes made to the codebase to focus on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), including bug fixes, code quality improvements, and features removed or commented out for MVP focus.

---

## Backend Changes

- **Webhook Handlers**: Commented out all Stripe and Paddle webhook endpoints and handler functions in `subscriptions.py` as they were not implemented. (TODOs left for future implementation.)
- **Naming Consistency**: Standardized translation API field names to `source_lang` and `target_lang` for consistency across backend and frontend.
- **General**: No critical bugs found in authentication, translation, or subscription endpoints. Error handling and logging are in place.

---

## Frontend Changes

- **Social Login**: Commented out all Google/Microsoft social login buttons and related logic in `Login.tsx` and `Register.tsx` for MVP focus.
- **Password Strength Meter**: Commented out the `PasswordStrengthMeter` component and its usage in registration for MVP simplification.
- **Advanced Features**: Commented out or removed advanced/modern features in the following files:
  - `ModernSubscription.tsx`: Professional/advanced subscription plans commented out.
  - `ComplianceRules.tsx` (component): Entire component commented out.
  - `ComplianceRules.tsx` (page): Not modified, but assumed non-essential for MVP.
  - `ProfessionalTranslation.tsx`, `UsageBilling.tsx`, `Translations.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `TranslationWorkspace.tsx`: Comments added for future removal of advanced features if needed.
- **API Consistency**: Standardized API calls in `api.ts` and type definitions in `types/index.ts` to use `source_lang` and `target_lang`.

## Code Quality Improvements

- Added comments to all major changes for clarity and future reference.
- Ensured all endpoints and API calls use consistent field names.
- Removed or commented out incomplete or non-essential features for MVP.

---

## Assumptions

- MVP includes: user registration/login, translation creation/listing, and subscription/usage display.
- Social login, compliance templates, advanced billing, and admin features are not required for MVP.
- Webhook handling for payment providers is not required for MVP but is marked as TODO for future implementation.

---

## Next Steps (Post-MVP)
- Implement and test webhook handlers for Stripe and Paddle.
- Re-enable and complete social login and compliance features.
- Add advanced analytics, dashboards, and admin tools as needed.
- Refactor and optimize code for scalability and maintainability.

---

**Summary:**
The codebase is now streamlined for MVP, focusing on core user authentication, translation, and subscription features. Non-essential and incomplete features are commented out for clarity and future development. All changes are documented for easy reference and future expansion.
